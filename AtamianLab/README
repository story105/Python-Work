These files are a program that helps search a large file to find certain contigs that we seek to analyze. The file is a FASTA 
produced by Trinity, and each '>' indicated a new contig. The varying length means that each section needs to be printed
without counting lines, the only iteration occurs on initial reading to find each strand of RNA's line number. The given .txt file
works, and if you created a larger .txt file or .fasta or whatever may suit you then it will still run the same: run time being
O(n) in worst case. Certain strands you seek should be known, enter the line number into the set "randomList," which, looking back on it,
is a poor name choice.
